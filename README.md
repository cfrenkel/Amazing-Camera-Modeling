# Camera Modeling

## Simulates camera operation in 3D modeling, 

With using a pixels panel, I calculating the meeting point of the ray with the objects. 
By given the prior knowledge of the objects placement, lighting, and the object material, 
I draw the pixel with the matching color.

The modeling also considers factors such as shadow, refraction, reflection, etc.

The project dividing to packages and using unit tests throughout the project.
